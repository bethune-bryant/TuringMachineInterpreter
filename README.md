# TuringMachineInterpreter
This program was written to aid in the understanding of Turing Machines.
It does so by allowing the user to execute Turing Machines and trace their execution.
It was specifically designed to allow the execution of Turing Machines as they are 
defined in Turing’s paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to The Entscheidungsproblem.

Usage:
TuringInterpreter.exe <fileName=input.txt> <flag=arrow-state>
